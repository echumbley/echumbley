My name is Edward Chumbley, and I'm a junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. I'm interested in learning all that I can and getting an internship to help me narrow my interests within the field. I'm also hoping to find time to start working on getting my private pilot's license. 

I love the outdoors and I love traveling; I often find myself looking for the next cool location to go hiking or even scuba diving. I enjoy photography and artistic projects though I usually don't have any time for hobbies because of class work. 

I'm hoping to gain experience in using Python from this course, since it seems to be a widely used coding language, and having a good understanding of it might help me in future classes, projects, or internships.
